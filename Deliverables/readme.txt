I was having issues geting git to work until the last day, but the last day when I was wrapping up the program, I did a bunch of commits and have a history there. I wrote all the code previous to that day on my local machine in notepad and just managed a history myself. My issue was I had a "credential.helper" set for some reason and it was giving me errors when trying to push pull etc. Anytime I had to put in my github token, it wouldn't work.
